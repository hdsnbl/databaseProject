"A description of your database, including tables, attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, foreign key constraints, 
FDs, whether in 3NF, and one or two rows of sample data for each table."

Certainly! Below is a description of your database, including tables, attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, foreign key constraints, FDs, whether in 3NF, and one or two rows of sample data for each table:

### Game Table:

**Attributes:**
- `GameID` (Primary Key)
- `Title`
- `Developer`
- `Genre`

**Primary Key:**
- `GameID`

**Foreign Keys:**
- None in this case.

**Functional Dependencies (FDs):**
1. GameID → Title, Developer, Genre
2. Title → Developer, Genre
3. Developer → Title, Genre
4. Genre → Title, Developer

**Normalization (3NF):**
Since there are no composite keys, and all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key, the table is in 3rd Normal Form.

**Sample Data:**

| GameID | Title        | Developer       | Genre  |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1      | Jump King    | Jump Queen      | Jump   |
| 2      | Sample Title | Sample Developer| Sample Genre |

### User Table:

**Attributes:**
- `UserID` (Primary Key)
- `Username`
- `Email`
- `Password`

**Primary Key:**
- `UserID`

**Foreign Keys:**
- None in this case.

**Functional Dependencies (FDs):**
1. UserID → Username, Email, Password
2. Username → UserID, Email, Password
3. Email → UserID, Username, Password

**Normalization (3NF):**
Since there are no composite keys, and all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key, the table is in 3rd Normal Form.

**Sample Data:**

| UserID | Username | Email           | Password |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| 1      | Boxi     | boxi@gmail.com  | 123      |
| 2      | Sample   | sample@email.com| pass123  |

### Review Table:

**Attributes:**
- `ReviewID` (Primary Key)
- `Rating`
- `Comment`
- `GameID` (Foreign Key references Game)
- `UserID` (Foreign Key references User)

**Primary Key:**
- `ReviewID`

**Foreign Keys:**
- `GameID` references `Game.GameID`
- `UserID` references `User.UserID`

**Functional Dependencies (FDs):**
1. ReviewID → Rating, Comment, GameID, UserID
2. Rating → ReviewID, Comment, GameID, UserID
3. Comment → ReviewID, Rating, GameID, UserID
4. GameID → ReviewID, Rating, Comment, UserID
5. UserID → ReviewID, Rating, Comment, GameID

**Normalization (3NF):**
Since there are no transitive dependencies and all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key, the table is in 3rd Normal Form.

**Sample Data:**

| ReviewID | Rating | Comment      | GameID | UserID |
|----------|--------|--------------|--------|--------|
| 1        | 10     | Good Game    | 1      | 1      |
| 2        | 8      | Enjoyed it   | 1      | 2      |

### Favorites Table:

**Attributes:**
- `FavoriteID` (Primary Key)
- `UserID` (Foreign Key references User)
- `GameID` (Foreign Key references Game)

**Primary Key:**
- `FavoriteID`

**Foreign Keys:**
- `UserID` references `User.UserID`
- `GameID` references `Game.GameID`

**Functional Dependencies (FDs):**
1. FavoriteID → UserID, GameID
2. UserID → FavoriteID, GameID
3. GameID → FavoriteID, UserID

**Normalization (3NF):**
Since there are no transitive dependencies and all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key, the table is in 3rd Normal Form.

**Sample Data:**

| FavoriteID | UserID | GameID |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 1          | 1      | 1      |
| 2          | 2      | 2      |

This structure and sample data provide a basic representation of your database. Depending on your specific requirements, you might need to adjust the design accordingly.
